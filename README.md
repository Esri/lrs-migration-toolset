# LRS Migration Toolset

This repository hosts the LRS Migration Toolset for ArcGIS Pro. The LRS Migration Toolset contains Python tools that can assist you in migrating your data from ArcMap to ArcGIS Pro. Each tool in this toolset is designed to be run only once as a step in a larger data migration.

## Features

The LRS Migration Toolset contains two tools:
* Migrate Calibration Points - Updates Calibration Points on an LRS Network.
* Fix Intersections as Referents in LRS Events - Converts ArcMap LRS Event referents to ArcGIS Pro LRS Event referents.

## Instructions

1. Download this repository as a .zip folder, or clone it to your computer.
2. Open a project in ArcGIS Pro.
3. Open the Catalog pane.
4. Right click the Toolboxes folder, then click Add Toolbox.
5. Browse to the LRS Migration Toolset.pyt folder you downloaded.
6. Select LRS Migration Toolset.pyt, then click OK.

Note: Use the Calculate Intersecting Route Measures tool to create a related table of all the routes and measures at each intersection location.

Please refer to the LRS migration whitepaper document for specific information on these tools.
